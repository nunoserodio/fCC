				<h2>Biography</h2>
				<p>José de Sousa Saramago (16 November 1922 – 18 June 2010), was a Portuguese writer and recipient of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Literature. His works have been translated into 25 languages, and can often be seen as allegories, presenting subversive human perspectives on historic events. <br><br>A proponent of libertarian communism, Saramago criticized institutions such as the Catholic Church, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. An atheist, he defended love as an instrument to improve the human condition.<br><br>In 1992, the Government of Portugal ordered the removal of one of his works, The Gospel According to Jesus Christ, from the Aristeion Prize's shortlist, claiming the work was religiously offensive. Disheartened by this political censorship of his work, Saramago went into exile on the Spanish island of Lanzarote, where he lived alongside his Spanish wife Pilar del Río until his death in 2010.<br><br>Saramago was a founding member of the National Front for the Defense of Culture in Lisbon in 1992, and co-founder of the European Writers' Parliament (EWP).</p>
